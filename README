DESCRIPTION
    Git::Garden is a project to graph git repositories in a manner that will
    allow display of them in various forms, be they direct images, ASCII or web
    interfaces.

    This project is still in a heavy prototyping phase. The code is honestly
    quite crap right now, as i'm just throwing shit at the wall to see what
    sticks. The plan is to have a Git::Garden module that'll be handed a list of
    commit objects that are interconnected by way of ref and parent relations
    and then transforms that into a representation of a graph log as a
    two-dimensional grid array that can then be passed on to render objects.
    Just how that'll all go together is something i'm busy finding out right
    now.

  History
    This project was started because Gitalist lacks a git log graph. It was
    forked off git-forest, which was investigatively dissected and then rebuilt
    with its ideas left intact, but the output radically transformed. The new
    log graphing algorithm was heavily inspired by QGit, but diverges in a few
    details.
